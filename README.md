# 🏡 ANAV Lifespaces – Real Estate Website

A fully responsive, modern real estate website built for a real client — my brother’s friend — using **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript**.

This project helped me explore real-world website development, client requirements, and responsive design across devices. It includes all key sections a real estate business needs — from project showcases to enquiry forms.

## 📖 Project Story

As a 1st-year Computer Engineering (AIML) student, I’m passionate about bringing real-world ideas to life through code.

Once I built the entire website and deployed it online, I tested it on mobile — and noticed several layout issues.  
Some sections were misaligned and the spacing broke the flow of the content.  
After trial and error, I fixed the entire mobile layout using just **4–5 lines of clean CSS** — proving that **attention to detail and real-device testing** are crucial parts of the development process.
